# Real-Time Deviation Monitoring

## What You'll See Now

When you run `python collaborator.py --debug`, you'll now get continuous deviation monitoring:

### Example Output:
```
âœ“ Debug mode: ENABLED (via command line)
âœ“ MIDI output initialized on port 0
Starting KitchenSync Collaborator 'pi-38417'
âœ… Collaborator pi-38417 started successfully!
Collaborator ready. Waiting for time sync from leader...
ðŸš€ Session started at 01:20:44
ðŸŽµ Started MIDI playback

ðŸ“Š Sync: leader=5.230s â†’ video=5.225s â†’ deviation=-0.005s
ðŸ“Š Sync: leader=7.430s â†’ video=7.425s â†’ deviation=-0.005s
ðŸ“Š Sync: leader=9.630s â†’ video=9.640s â†’ deviation=+0.010s
ðŸ”„ Sync correction: 0.242s deviation
ðŸ“Š Sync: leader=12.030s â†’ video=12.025s â†’ deviation=-0.005s
```

### Frequency Options
The monitoring appears every **0.2 seconds** (every 10 sync messages at 50Hz).

**To adjust frequency, change the modulo value:**
```python
# In _handle_sync method:
if self.sync_message_count % 10 == 0:  # Current: every 0.2s

# Other options:
if self.sync_message_count % 5 == 0:   # Every 0.1s (faster)
if self.sync_message_count % 25 == 0:  # Every 0.5s (slower)  
if self.sync_message_count % 50 == 0:  # Every 1.0s (slowest)
```

## What Each Value Means

**ðŸ“Š Sync: leader=5.230s â†’ video=5.225s â†’ deviation=-0.005s**

- **leader=5.230s**: Time position the leader is broadcasting
- **video=5.225s**: Current position of this collaborator's video
- **deviation=-0.005s**: How far behind (-) or ahead (+) this collaborator is
  - Negative = collaborator is behind leader
  - Positive = collaborator is ahead of leader
  - Goal is to keep this close to 0.000s

## When Corrections Happen

The system will trigger a sync correction when the **median deviation** (filtered from multiple samples) exceeds the threshold (typically 0.2s).

**You'll see both:**
1. **Continuous monitoring**: Shows real-time deviation every 0.2s
2. **Correction events**: Shows when actual sync corrections are applied

This gives you complete visibility into how well the collaborator is staying in sync with the leader.

## Production vs Debug

- **Production mode**: Only shows correction events (ðŸ”„ Sync correction)
- **Debug mode**: Shows continuous monitoring (ðŸ“Š Sync) + correction events

Now you can see exactly how the sync is performing in real-time!
